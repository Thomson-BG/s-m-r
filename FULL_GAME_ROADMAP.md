2. Basic combat system
3. Building construction
4. Resource collection mechanics

### Short Term (1 month)
1. Enemy AI behaviors
2. Full tech tree implementation
3. Production systems
4. Enhanced UI controls

### Medium Term (2-3 months)
1. Campaign system
2. Superweapons
3. Naval/air units
4. Advanced AI

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. Multiplayer system
2. Map editor

4. Complete audio/visual polish

## Estimated Development Effort
- **Core RTS Features**: 400-600 hours
- **C&C Specific Content**: 200-300 hours  
- **Polish & Testing**: 200-400 hours
- **Total**: 800-1300 hours (1-2 years for single developer)

## Conclusion
The current foundation is solid with good architecture, but the game needs extensive gameplay mechanics to become a fully functional RTS. The most critical missing piece is actual unit interaction - movement, combat, and construction. Once these core mechanics are implemented, the game can progressively add more advanced features to reach full C&C:RA2 parity.
