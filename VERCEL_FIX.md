# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: No Output Directory named "public" found after the Build completed. 
Configure the Output Directory in your Project Settings. 
Alternatively, configure vercel.json#outputDirectory.
```

## Root Cause
The `vercel.json` was configured to use `@vercel/static-build` which expects a build process to create an output directory. However, this is a pure static HTML/CSS/JS game that doesn't require any build process.

## Solution
1. **Removed unnecessary build configuration** from `vercel.json`:
   - Removed the `builds` array that was using `@vercel/static-build`
   - Removed the `functions` section which is not needed for static sites

2. **Simplified the configuration** to treat this as a pure static site:
   - Vercel now serves files directly from the repository root
   - All game files (index.html, css/, js/, assets/) are in the correct location

3. **Updated package.json** build script to be cleaner (though it's not used by Vercel anymore)

## Key Changes

### Before (vercel.json):
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "."
      }
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "app": {
      "includeFiles": "**"
    }
  }
}
```

### After (vercel.json):
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "scotty-masons-revenge",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ],
  // ... headers and other config remain the same
}
```

## Result
- Vercel now treats this as a static site deployment
- No build process is attempted
- Files are served directly from the repository root
- Deployment should succeed without the "public directory" error

## File Structure (Root Level)
```
/
├── index.html              # Main entry point
├── css/                    # Stylesheets
├── js/                     # Game logic
├── assets/                 # Images, icons, etc.
├── manifest.json           # PWA manifest
├── sw.js                   # Service worker
└── vercel.json            # Deployment config
```

This structure is now compatible with Vercel's static site hosting.
